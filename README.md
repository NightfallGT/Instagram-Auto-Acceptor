# Instagram-Auto-Acceptor
A script that automatically accepts all your pending follow requests.


## About
This tool bulk accepts follow requests, meaning it accepts all pending requests in your account . It then checks/ scans your account every 9 seconds in default for any pending requests. You may change the delay in seconds, and limit the accounts you will accept in each iteration. Make sure you 
are already logged on Instagram in the pc you will be using this 
script in as this does not have a challenge solver yet.

Your account must be private to use this tool.
